# LC3-Lean

A Proof System in Lean for LC3 Programs

LC3 architecture from [this article](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/#what-is-a-virtual-machine-)

Another example, in Rust is [this repo](https://github.com/atul-g/rust_vm)

# TODO:
* state changes, jumps
* custom tactics 
* initial state/induction over state trace

Once implemented, might go through examples at [this link](https://github.com/dideler/LC-3-Programs) and formally verify them.
